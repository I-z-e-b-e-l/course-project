Directions:

1. Make sure you are in the homework-2 branch of your course project in VS Code. Create a new branch called homework-3, and do all the work for this assignment in that branch. 

2. You should have a folder called "public" that contains a folder called "images." Inside the "public" folder (outside the "images" folder), create a folder called "styles" and inside the "styles" folder, create a file called styles.css

3. Connect all 6 of your HTML pages to the styles.css file through the <head> tags. 

4. Start styling your pages so they mimic the mockup. You are focusing on the navigation bar and the footer in this version of your site. You should be mainly utilizing classes to select elements to style. 
    
    a. Take out any inline CSS you included in your html pages and replace it with class or element selecting. (The CSS that everyone should have is on the images on the index.html page for the comic book covers.)

5. You are also creating one new page that will contain a "comic card" for one of the comic books on your site. You can choose any of the 12 comics. 

    a. You'll need to create a new html page named after the comic title. 

    b. Include the same navbar and footer as the other html pages.

    c. Use the mockup that corresponds with your comic to recreate the card. The text you need for each card is located at the end of this file.

    d. On the index page, link the associated comic book image and the "Details" link below the comic book to your new HTML page. (Users should be able to click the comic book cover picture or click "Details" underneath it and be taken to the comic's card.)

6. When you're finished, push your changes on the homework-3 branch to your GitHub repository, and copy and paste the link in the assignment submission spot in Moodle.

Title: Wake: The Hidden History of Women-Led Slave Revolts
Author: Rebecca Hall
Publisher: Simon Schuster
Genre: nonfiction
Number of pages: 208
Rating: 5
Synopsis: Part graphic novel, part memoir, Wake is an imaginative tour-de-force that tells the story of women-led slave revolts and chronicles scholar Rebecca Hall’s efforts to uncover the truth about these women warriors who, until now, have been left off the historical record.

Women warriors planned and led slave revolts on slave ships during the Middle Passage. They fought their enslavers throughout the Americas. And then they were erased from history.

Wake tells the story of Dr. Rebecca Hall, a historian, granddaughter of slaves, and a woman haunted by the legacy of slavery. The accepted history of slave revolts has always told her that enslaved women took a back seat. But Rebecca decides to look deeper, and her journey takes her through old court records, slave ship captain’s logs, crumbling correspondence, and even the forensic evidence from the bones of enslaved women from the “negro burying ground” uncovered in Manhattan. She finds women warriors everywhere.

Using in-depth archival research and a measured use of historical imagination, Rebecca constructs the likely pasts of Adono and Alele, women rebels who fought for freedom during the Middle Passage, as well as the stories of women who led slave revolts in Colonial New York. We also follow Rebecca’s own story as the legacy of slavery shapes life, both during her time as a successful attorney and later as a historian seeking the past that haunts her.

Illustrated beautifully in black and white, Wake will take its place alongside classics of the graphic novel genre, like Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis and Art Spiegelman’s Maus. The story of both a personal and national legacy, it is a powerful reminder that while the past is gone, we still live in its wake.

Rating: 5
Synopsis: March is a vivid first-hand account of John Lewis’ lifelong struggle for civil and human rights, meditating in the modern age on the distance traveled since the days of Jim Crow and segregation. Rooted in Lewis’ personal story, it also reflects on the highs and lows of the broader civil rights movement.

Book One spans John Lewis’ youth in rural Alabama, his life-changing meeting with Martin Luther King, Jr., the birth of the Nashville Student Movement, and their battle to tear down segregation through nonviolent lunch counter sit-ins, building to a stunning climax on the steps of City Hall.

Many years ago, John Lewis and other student activists drew inspiration from the 1950s comic book "Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story." Now, his own comics bring those days to life for a new audience, testifying to a movement whose echoes will be heard for generations.



Title: Batman: The Dark Knight Returns
Author: Frank Miller
Publisher: DC Comics
Genre: superhero
Number of pages: 197
Rating: 3
Synopsis: This masterpiece of modern comics storytelling brings to vivid life a dark world and an even darker man. Together with inker Klaus Janson and colorist Lynn Varley, writer/artist Frank Miller completely reinvents the legend of Batman in his saga of a near-future Gotham City gone to rot, ten years after the Dark Knight's retirement.

Crime runs rampant in the streets, and the man who was Batman is still tortured by the memories of his parents' murders. As civil society crumbles around him, Bruce Wayne's long-suppressed vigilante side finally breaks free of its self-imposed shackles.

The Dark Knight returns in a blaze of fury, taking on a whole new generation of criminals and matching their level of violence. He is soon joined by this generation's Robin—a girl named Carrie Kelley, who proves to be just as invaluable as her predecessors.

But can Batman and Robin deal with the threat posed by their deadliest enemies, after years of incarceration have made them into perfect psychopaths? And more important, can anyone survive the coming fallout of an undeclared war between the superpowers—or a clash of what were once the world's greatest superheroes?

Over fifteen years after its debut, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns remains an undisputed classic and one of the most influential stories ever told in the comics medium.



Title: Queer: A Graphic History
Author: Meg-John Barker
Publisher: Icon Books
Genre: nonfiction
Number of pages: 176
Rating: 4
Synopsis: Activist-academic Meg-John Barker and cartoonist Julia Scheele illuminate the histories of queer thought and LGBTQ+ action in this groundbreaking non-fiction graphic novel.

From identity politics and gender roles to privilege and exclusion, Queer explores how we came to view sex, gender and sexuality in the ways that we do; how these ideas get tangled up with our culture and our understanding of biology, psychology and sexology; and how these views have been disputed and challenged.

Along the way we look at key landmarks which shift our perspective of what’s ‘normal’ – Alfred Kinsey’s view of sexuality as a spectrum, Judith Butler’s view of gendered behaviour as a performance, the play Wicked, or moments in Casino Royale when we’re invited to view James Bond with the kind of desiring gaze usually directed at female bodies in mainstream media.

Presented in a brilliantly engaging and witty style, this is a unique portrait of the universe of queer thinking.
